# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

Install all dependencies for a project.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn add`

Allows multiple versions of the same dependency to be installed, each referenced via the alias-package name given.

### `yarn lint`

Analyzes source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

### Style for components structure:

```
/Button
  index.ts
  Button.tsx
  Button.test.tsx
  styles.ts
  types.ts
  ```

### Working style with styled-components:

```
import * as S from "./styles";
<S.Wrapper></S.Wrapper>
```

### Colors settings pattern:

Colors
‚ùó Ô∏èIf you add a new color, you must indicate the HEX color in the comment.

‚ùóÔ∏è If you want to add transparency to the color you should add 2 digits at the end of the name.

‚ùóÔ∏è We use camel case for color naming.

üëç Example of correct code:

```
  black: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)' as const, // #000000
  black20: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)' as const, // #000000
  atomicTangerine02: 'rgba(255, 151, 106, 0.02)' as const, // #FFA26F
```

Services
We use this service - https://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/#6195ED to generate color names.

‚ùóÔ∏è If the service generates the same names, use the existing color.

### Commits convention: 
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) provides easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history, by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.
The commit message should be structured as follows:
- \<type\>[optional scope]: \<description\>
- [optional body]
- [optional footer(s)]

Some important rules:
1. fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase.
2. feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase.
3. types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.
4. Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"

Example: 
- feat: remove ticket list endpoint
- feat(lang): add Polish language
- fix: add missing parameter to service call

### Localization mechanism:
It's necessary to add EN and RU translations to correct folder (src/localization/translations).
If you have any words/phrases/sentences in your component, you have to write them in a `i18n.tsx` file and two json files in correct folder (depends on language - EN or RU).
After that all these words/phrases/sentences in your component have to be wrapped in a construction like: `{t("header.userProfile")}`, where `header` and `userProfile` are the keys for translation.
Instead of `header.userProfile` you will be use your keys taken from json files.
Also need to import `{ useTranslation }` from `react-i18next` library and inside your component use the construct `const { t } = useTranslation()`.
Example of correct code:
```
import React from "react";
import { useTranslation } from "react-i18next";
const YourComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const { t } = useTranslation();
  return <div>{t("header.userProfile")}</div>;
};
export default YourComponent;
```
